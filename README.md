This is a tool build using java and shell scripting.
Here, i used java because cui is easier in it.

In my code, i listen if any pendrive is inserted, which
I did by hardcoding the location of pen drive folders and checking if 
any new folder is created. If yes, then i list all extensions 
present and the user can specify the operation to be performed.
